		<h3> We know. You're tired, and just want to go home after work.<br>
			But you need to eat...</h3><br>

			<p> So do you just go home anyway and worry about it when you get there? Should you order pizza? Chinese? What if you just want a good old fashioned healthy-ish meal?</p><br>		
			<p>
			Let us help you. First, yes, just go home! When you get there, pull us up and browse our featured seasonal recipes that are 30 minutes or less to prepare. Then ask yourself: Do any of these look good?</p><br>

			<p>If yes, just use your finger to place your order. Either pick all the items listed for that recipe, or only pick the ones you need, and we'll bring what you need to your waiting, hungry-hippo hands.</p><br>

			<p>Oh wait, do you need milk (etc.) for the morning...? Just add it to your digital grocery list and we'll grab that too.

			<h1> What is Home Delivery? </h1>

			<p>Users don't have to commit through a subscription to a certain amount of weekly meals like other home delivery food companies. They just order when they want.</p>

			<p>Home Delivery matches drivers with users who request home delivered groceries through our app, and users pay automatically through the app anytime they order.</p>

			<p>We take care of placing orders, all you do is pick it up from the store and deliver it to their door. Just switch your driver status to available and accept the pick up jobs as they come to you.</p>
